The Java2D renderer
===================

This renderer is intended to be used for portable rendering using Java. The goal is to fully
implement the CSS designed in the Core UI package.

The basic rendering scheme is to browse style groups in order. 
Each group contains a set of elements pertaining to the same style.
For each group the corresponding element shape is setup globally to configure all the unchanging
parts for each element (shape form, size if it is not dynamic, etc.).

Then for each element, a new configuration of the shape is done for dynamic parts if needed, if
the color is set via an attribute, if the icon is changed via an attribute, etc. The sizes are
checked if the size mode is to fit to the contents, etc.

Then the rendering really occurs once.

If there are shadows, this rendering starts anew, but only configuring things used for shadows
(size and shadow colors). 

The camera
----------

The camera is in charge of setting the view, telling which elements are visible or not (could
improve things a lot for very large rendering, simply start in a place of the graph and browse
through it without ever viewing it globally).

The renderers
-------------

Renderers are very simple things that manipulate shapes, set them up, and render them.

The Shapes
----------

This is where the rendering really occurs. All is done to set up things once for each style, not
once for each element, as most often elements share the same style.
