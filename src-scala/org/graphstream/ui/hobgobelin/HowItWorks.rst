The goal of this viewer is, like the default GraphStream viewer, to provide a
very simple graph renderer that only renders simple circular nodes and sprites
and simple line edges with colors, but using OpenGL instead of Java2D.

The purpose of the viewer is to remain simple, but however to allow rendering
the graphs as fast as possible, and to allow the handling of graphs as large
as possible.
